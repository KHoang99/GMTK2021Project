A conjunction of two different things I was looking into in the Summer of 2021

1. Working in Blender3d to model customizable 3d meshes. 

2. Working with unity  to create abilities that affects the player and environment features.

After working a considerably amount of time on finishing a introductory blender tutorial I thought about ways I can export it the model with its materials into Unity. 

Then for goofs I thought about the idea of how I can show it to my friends, where I would I first show  them a rendered model of a donut, picking it up , throwing it  and "breaking" all those hard hours of works .

I then found a way to cut up the mesh in blender and implement a system that "simulates" the donut breaking. I had stumbled across the amazing Mix and Jam's video on trying to recreate Superhot and thought it would be a suitable system that my breakable donut can be apart of.
